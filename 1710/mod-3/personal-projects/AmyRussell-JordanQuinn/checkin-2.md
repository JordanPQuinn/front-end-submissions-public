## Project Name:
Roastr

#### Check In: 2

#### Progress made?

- Firebase user authentication set up
- submitting a roaster persists to the data base, can pull them as well, just need to put it into the store when user signs in
- Styling coming together

- Refactoring 

#### What deliverables still need to be completed from your last checkin?

#### Next Steps?

Continue working on email

Tests, tests, and a side of tests
Decide on an extension and do it

#### What are your concerns (if any)
